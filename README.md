We have Data matrix X and response data vector Y,We have a losso expression, we want to compute the parameter β
.

First,we choose the penality parameter λ
.

Second, we standarized the X
 and Y
.

Last, we use this package to get β
 accroding to the coordinate descent and proximal operator algorithm.
